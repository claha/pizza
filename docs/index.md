# Pizza Dough

My favorite pizza dough recipe.

## Poolish Dough Base

- Refer to the table below for the amounts of fresh yeast, cold water, honey,
  and flour needed to make the poolish dough base.
- In a mixing bowl, combine fresh yeast and cold water until well mixed.
- Add honey and flour, and stir everything together.
- Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature
  for 1 hour.
- Transfer the mixture to the fridge and let it sit for 16-24 hours.
- Remove the poolish from the fridge 30 minutes before making the dough.

## Dough Preparation

- Refer to the table below for the amounts of cold water, flour, and salt needed
  to make the dough.
- Combine the poolish and water in a mixing bowl, and stir to combine.
- Add salt and flour, and mix everything together by hand or using a dough machine.
- Cover the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes.
- Grease your hands with olive oil and use the slap and fold technique to shape the
  dough into a smooth ball.
- Place the dough in a greased container, cover it, and let it rest in the fridge
  for 16-24 hours for a double fermented dough. Alternatively, let it rest at room
  temperature for 30 minutes, covered.
- If making the double fermented dough, let it rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours
  before making the pizza balls.
- Divide the dough into the desired number of balls and let them rest at room temperature
  for about 2 hours before making the pizza.
