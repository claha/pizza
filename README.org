* Pizza Dough

My favorite pizza dough recipes.

** Poolish

This is the base (the poolish) for the dough using poolish. The measurements in
the table below are given in grams, uses cold water and fresh yeast.

| Water | Flour | Yeast | Honey |
|-------+-------+-------+-------|
|   300 |   300 |    10 |     5 |

Mix the yeast and water until combined. Then add the honey and flour and mix
together. Put on a lid (or plastic wrap) and let it sit at room temperature for
1 hour, then put it in the fridge for 16 to 24 hours. Take out the poolish from
the fridge 30 minutes before doing the dough.

The table below shows how much more cold water, flour and salt is needed to
make the desired number of dough balls. This will give a dough with 67%
hydration, i.e. the water to flour ratio is 2:3.

| Balls | Water | Flour | Salt |
|-------+-------+-------+------|
|     4 |   100 |   300 |   16 |
|     6 |   300 |   600 |   24 |
|     8 |   500 |   900 |   32 |
|    10 |   700 |  1200 |   40 |

Make the dough by combining poolish with water, then add the salt and flour and
work it all together. Either by hand or using a dough machine. Cover the dough
and let it rest for 15 minutes. Put olive oil on hands and use the slap and
fold technique to make it into a big smooth ball. Either let the dough rest in
a greased (olive oil) container in the fridge for 16 to 24 hours (this gives a
double fermented dough) or put some olive oil on it, cover and let it rest for
30 minutes at room temperature. If making the double fermented dough let it
rest for 1 to 2 horus at room temperature before making the pizza balls. Divide
the dough and make into the desired number of balls. Let them reset at room
temperature for about 2 hours before making the pizza.
